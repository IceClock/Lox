# SalmonPy - LOX Interpreter 

## Description

<b>SalmonPy</b> is a LOX interpreter created for the first project of CS 403/503 Programming Languages course during the Fall semester 2022 at The University of Alabama (Roll Tide!!!).

To create <b>SalmonPy</b> we used Robert Nystrom's book "<b>Crafting Interpreters</b>" as a guide text. We chose Python because it is a new language for the three of us and we thought that developing the interpreter in this programming language would help us to improve our knowledge of it.

## Timeline

- The Scanner was the first part of <b>SalmonPy</b>. It was finished on September 21, 2022

## ¿Why SalmonPy?

The word lox in American English is derived from the Proto-Indo-European language, pronounced as it is pronounced today. This word has cognates in many Germanic languages. An example of this is that in the Scandinavian languages, the word "lax" or "laks" means "salmon". It is very likely that it existed in its current form in some Proto-Indo-European language, given its current wide distribution. In fact, today the word "Lox" refers to a brined salmon fillet, which may or may not be smoked.

Given that this project is developed for a Programming Languages class, and that the coincidence of the name of the LOX programming language, with the word "lox" that has transcended so many languages over time, it seemed appropriate to call "SalmonPy " to our interpreter. In addition, there will surely already be many versions of Lox interpreters written in Python that combine the names of the two languages in some way (Pylox, Plox, Loxpy, etc).
